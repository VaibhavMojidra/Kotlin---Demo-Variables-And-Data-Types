# Kotlin---Demo-Variables-And-Data-Types

In Kotlin, variables are used to store data values that can be manipulated throughout the program. When declaring a variable in Kotlin, you need to specify its data type.

Kotlin has several built-in data types, including:

1. Byte: an 8-bit signed integer
2. Short: a 16-bit signed integer
3. Int: a 32-bit signed integer
4. Long: a 64-bit signed integer
5. Float: a 32-bit floating point number
6. Double: a 64-bit floating point number
7. Char: a single Unicode character
8. Boolean: a true/false value
9. String: Sequence of characters

To declare a variable in Kotlin, you use the var keyword followed by the variable name and its data type.
